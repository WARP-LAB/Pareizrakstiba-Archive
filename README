Latvian Spellcheck

Mac OSX service that adds support for system
wide spellchecking in Latvian language.

Requirements

Mac OS 10.7.+ Intel 32 & 64-bit
Beta release

Installation

• If you want to set up this Latvian spellcheck then a change in system preferences is
	required due to the new sandboxing and certification model.
	Under System Preferences : Security & Privacy : General change settings of
	Allow applications downloaded from to Anywhere.
	Default for OS X 10.7 is Anywhere
	Default for OS X 10.8 is Mac App Store and identified developers
• Install using Uzstādīt Pareizrakstību.pkg
• Run Iespējot Pareizrakstību (Enable Pareizrakstība) and restart the computer.
• If Latvian spellcheck does not show after the restart repeat the enabling process.
• The installation sets up Latvian spellcheck for the whole system, however each
	user account needs to enable it seperately.

• Use Izdzēst Pareizrakstību to remove the spellcheck from the system.

• Pareizrakstība cannot utilise the functionality introduced in Mac OS 10.6, where
	choosing Automatic by Language in spelling panel enables checking for multiple
	languages at once. Functions such as Smart Quotes, Smart
	Dashes, Smart Links, Data Detectors are also disabled. This decision has been
	made based on the fact that OSX API has a bug.

Notes

• Make sure that in applications Latvian spellcheck is selected
	Edit : Spelling and Grammar : Show Spelling and Grammar : Latvian
• NeoOffice & OpenOffice.org users have no need to install dictionaries from
	File : Wizards : Install New Dictionaries, for the mentioned applications
	use OSX system wide spellcheck. Besides, when using Pareizrakstība in the
	applications and adding new words, they will apply to the whole OS.
• Learned words are kept in ~/Library/Spelling/
